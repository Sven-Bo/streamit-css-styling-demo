# Streamlit CSS Styling Demo

A demo app that showcases how to apply custom CSS styling to Streamlit components using the new feature introduced in **Streamlit 1.39**. With this update, you can now set CSS classes on elements via the `key` parameter, making it super easy to customize the look and feel of your app!

In the app, I play around with different styles like animated buttons with pulse effects, custom fonts, and colorful inputs. It's a simple way to see what's possible with a bit of CSS magic in Streamlit.

If you're curious or want to try it out yourself, check out the live app here: [styling.streamlit.app](https://styling.streamlit.app/)

And if you want to upgrade your Streamlit version to try these features, just run:

```bash
pip install streamlit --upgrade
```

Happy styling! 🎨
